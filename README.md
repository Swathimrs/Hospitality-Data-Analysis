# Hospitality-Data-Analysis

  **Obsidian Grands**, a well-established hotel chain with a legacy spanning almost three decades, has been providing exceptional hospitality experiences across various cities in India, including Mumbai and Bangalore. Offering diverse room categories, from Standard to Presidential, Obsidian has become a go-to choose for travelers. Whether you book through MakeYourTrip, LogTrip, Tripster, Obsidian.com, or opt for the traditional offline booking route, they are dedicated to ensuring your stay is unforgettable.

Recently, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project for Obsidian. The objective was to analyze their extensive dataset, get valuable insights, and present them in a clear and impactful manner. Here's a sneak peek into some of the key findings and actions I took to achieve them:

1.	Average Room Occupancy Rates: I calculated the average occupancy rate for each room category, shedding light on the popularity of different room types.
   
2.	City-wise Occupancy Rates: Understanding the demand for Obsidian offerings in different cities, I presented average occupancy rates for each location.
	
3.	Weekdays vs. Weekends: I examined data to determine whether the occupancy rates were better on weekdays or weekends, helping Obsidian optimize pricing and promotions.
	
4.	June Occupancy Trends: Creating insightful bar charts, I showcased how occupancy rates varied across cities during the month of June.
	
5.	August Data Integration: When new data for August arrived, I seamlessly appended it to the existing dataset, ensuring data continuity for future analysis.
	
6.	Revenue by City: Calculating revenue realized per city, I revealed the financial performance of each location.
	
7.	Month-by-Month Revenue: With a month-by-month revenue analysis, I tracked financial performance throughout the year, identifying peak months.
  
8.	Revenue by Room Type: To support pricing strategies, I reported revenue realized per hotel room type, aiding in future decision-making.
	
9.	Average Ratings: Evaluating guest feedback, I determined the average rating per city, essential for maintaining quality standards.
  
10.	Booking Platforms: A delightful pie chart illustrated the distribution of revenue across different booking platforms, helping to fine-tune marketing efforts.


This project demonstrate my skills in **data analysis**, **Python**, **Pandas** and **data visualization (matpotlib)** in the business context. By getting these insights, Obsidian can enhance their service quality, optimize pricing, and improve customer experiences.
